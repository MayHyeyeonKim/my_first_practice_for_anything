    #2.12 LAB: Divide by x
Write a program using integers user_num and x as input, and output user_num divided by x three times.

Ex: If the input is:
2000
2

Then the output is:
1000 500 250

Note: In Python 3, integer division discards fractions. Ex: 6 // 4 is 1 (the 0.5 is discarded).

user_num = int(input())
x = int(input())
result = user_num // x
result1 = result // x
result2 = result1 // x
print(result, result1, result2)


    #2.13 LAB: Driving costs

Driving is expensive. Write a program with a car's gas milage (miles/gallon) and the cost of gas (dollars/gallon) as floating-point input, and output the gas cost for 20 miles, 75 miles, and 500 miles.

Output each floating-point value with two digits after the decimal point, which can be achieved as follows:
print(f'{your_value1:.2f} {your_value2:.2f} {your_value3:.2f}')

Ex: If the input is:

20.0
3.1599
where the gas mileage is 20.0 miles/gallon and the cost of gas is $3.1599/gallon, the output is:

3.16 11.85 79.00
Note: Real per-mile cost would also include maintenance and depreciation.

def driving_cost(driven_miles, miles_per_gallon, dollars_per_gallon):
    driving_cost = dollars_per_gallon * (driven_miles / miles_per_gallon)
    return driving_cost

if __name__ == '__main__':
    miles_per_gallon = float(input())
    dollars_per_gallon = float(input())
    driven_miles = 20
    result1 = ('%0.2f' % driving_cost(driven_miles, miles_per_gallon, dollars_per_gallon))
    driven_miles = 75
    result2 = ('%0.2f' % driving_cost(driven_miles, miles_per_gallon, dollars_per_gallon))
    driven_miles = 500
    result3 = ('%0.2f' % driving_cost(driven_miles, miles_per_gallon, dollars_per_gallon))

print(result1, result2, result3)


    #2.14 LAB: Expression for calories burned during workout

The following equation estimates the average calories burned for a person when exercising, which is based on a scientific journal article (source):

Calories = ( (Age x 0.2757) + (Weight x 0.03295) + (Heart Rate x 1.0781) â€” 75.4991 ) x Time / 8.368

Write a program using inputs age (years), weight (pounds), heart rate (beats per minute), and time (minutes), respectively. Output the average calories burned for a person.

Output each floating-point value with two digits after the decimal point, which can be achieved as follows:
print(f'Calories: {calories:.2f} calories')

Ex: If the input is:

49
155
148
60
then the output is:

Calories: 736.21 calories

age = float(input())
weight = float(input())
heart_rate = float(input())
time = float(input())
calories = ((age * 0.2757) + (weight * 0.03295) + (heart_rate * 1.0781) - 75.4991) * (time / 8.368)
print(f'Calories: {calories:.2f} calories')


    #2.15 LAB: Using math functions

Given three floating-point numbers x, y, and z, output x to the power of z, x to the power of (y to the power of z), the absolute value of (x minus y), and the square root of (x to the power of z).

Output each floating-point value with two digits after the decimal point, which can be achieved as follows:
print(f'{your_value1:.2f} {your_value2:.2f} {your_value3:.2f} {your_value4:.2f}')

Ex: If the input is:

5.0
1.5
3.2
Then the output is:

172.47 361.66 3.50 13.13

import math
x = float(input())
y = float(input())
z = float(input())

your_value1 = x**z
your_value2 = x**(y**z)
your_value3 = abs(x-y)
your_value4 = math.sqrt(x**z)

print(f'{your_value1:.2f} {your_value2:.2f} {your_value3:.2f} {your_value4:.2f}')
